Description
═══════════

  Anki-capture is an interface for adding notes to [Anki] from Emacs
  that is analogous to [org-capture]. It uses Org mode syntax to author
  notes so you can easily insert LaTeX formulas, images, and
  miscellaneous formatting. [Anki-editor] provides the layout for notes
  and the elisp backend connection to [AnkiConnect]. This package
  includes some helpful commands from [Cheong Yiufung] for quickly
  inserting cloze deletions.

Installation
════════════

  Using [straight.el] (recommended):

  ┌────
  │ (straight-use-package `(anki-capture :type git :repo "git://git.wrycode.com/wrycode/anki-capture.git"))
  └────

  I haven’t bothered with MELPA yet, but `anki-capture.el' is a standard
  elisp package (a single file with autoloads), so you can install it by
  visiting the buffer and running `package-install-from-buffer'.

Configuration
═════════════

  Here are some recommended (optional) settings. Substitute your own
  preferred keybindings:

  ┌────
  │ ;; cloze region using the next cloze number
  │ (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "M-n") 'anki-editor-cloze-region-auto-incr)
  │ ;; cloze region using the current cloze number
  │ (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "M-N") 'anki-editor-cloze-region-dont-incr)
  │
  │ (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "<f10>") 'anki-editor-reset-cloze-number)
  │
  │
  │ (setq anki-editor-create-decks t ;; Allow anki-editor to create a new deck if it doesn't exist
  │       anki-editor-org-tags-as-anki-tags t) ;; use Org mode tags as Anki note tags
  │
  │ (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c e") 'anki-capture) ;; capture a new note into Anki
  └────


Usage
═════

  The idea is that you can use `anki-editor'’s note format to add new
  notes to Anki as quickly as possible. Often you will want to add a
  series of similar notes. `anki-capture' will assume that you want the
  same note settings (Anki deck, tags, and Anki note type) each time you
  invoke it unless you use a prefix argument (C-u). See `anki-capture'’s
  docstring for more info: `C-h f anki-capture'.

  If you do not set `anki-capture-file', notes will be stored in a
  buffer called `*anki-capture-storage-buffer*'. This will NOT be saved
  if you restart Emacs.

  I recommend using underscores “`_'” to emulate spaces in your tags
  because this will work well in both Org mode and Anki.
